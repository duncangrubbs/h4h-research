# h4h-research
A ML research project using the Marin County Hack4Health dataset.

### How to use
This project uses Jupyter Notebooks. You will need to install jupyter notebooks on your machine and then
run `jupyter notebook` in the root of this directory.
This project also uses the TensorFlow machine learning platform, however most of the code within the
jupyter notebook is just data visualization.

### How to get the data
If you need the dataset, email me (The project won't work without it, but you can still look at the jupyter notebook).
